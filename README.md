Python-based Interface for Online-Judges.

This project aims at creating an extensible and interchangable interface for
managing with online judges with Python, universally compatible on all platforms.
This includes the ability to download and archive problem descriptions (or maybe
even data), and automatically submitting code to online judges.

Those who prefer more user-friendly interfaces, please redirect to @xmcp's
[JudgeLight](https://github.com/xmcp/JudgeLight), without criticism on the
user-friendliness of the interface of this project.

## Supported OJs
